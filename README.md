This is the repository for the HackTues3 Hackaton.

We failed miserably, I said 5 words to the jury and they were
all an incomplete mumbling. Our project didn't launch, the game
wasn't on the raspberry, because we decied to add new features
in the last 5 minutes before our presentation and nobody had the balls
to speak to the organiser to postpone our presentation.

At least it was fun!
hehe xd
